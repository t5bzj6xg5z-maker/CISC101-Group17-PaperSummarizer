Module 04: Rendering & Refinement

Logic & Steps
1. Combined Summary Generation
Bring together all the section summaries into one clear, flowing summary (about 100–300 words). Cut out anything repetitive. Keep the focus on the main findings and make sure the story makes sense from start to finish.

2. Formatting Consistency
Put everything together in the right order using Markdown. Stick to the same tone, summary level, and use the same terms throughout the document.

3. Glossary Compilation
Pick out important terms or abbreviations from the paper. Define them so everything stays clear.

Output
- Final Paper Summary
- Complete Set of Section Summaries
- Full Combined Summary (100–300 words)
- Glossary of Key Terms
