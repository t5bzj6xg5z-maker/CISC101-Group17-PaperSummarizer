# Module 1

## Logic & Steps
1. **User Input Verification**  
   - Check for the provided section list, summary level, and length preference.  
   - Make sure all paper sections are present and clearly labeled.  

2. **Section Detection**  
   - Read the academic paper and identify all labeled sections.  
   - Find any missing or empty sections and flag those with fewer than 50 words.  

3. **Preparation**  
   - Store the user's chosen summary level and length settings for the next steps.  
   - Get the parsed content ready for summarization.  

## Output  
- Move to the Section Loop only after all validation checks are complete.  
- If any issues are found, alert the user and wait for corrections.
