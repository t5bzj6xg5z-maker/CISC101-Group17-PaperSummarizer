 Section Loop in Module 02

## Change Log: To allow "short" and "deep" summary modes, the `summary_level` variable was added.
Conditional logic was introduced to regulate the format and duration of section summaries.
- maintained the 150-word limit and the original section sequence.

## Reasoning & Procedures

1. Original Order Enforcement: Adhere exactly to the original paper order when processing each section.

2. The variable summary_level = "short" OR "detailed" is introduced.

3. Generation of Conditional Summaries

   IF "brief" is the summary level:
   Write a brief synopsis of the section in one or two sentences.
   Concentrate solely on: - The main concept
     The main result or conclusion
   Make sure the summary is technically correct and no more than 150 words.

   IF "detailed" is the summary_level:
   Create a brief paragraph summarizing the section and a list of three to five important points highlighted in bullet points.
       Techniques
       Important conclusions
       Crucial ideas or findings
   The combined output (paragraph and bullets) needs to be kept.

   4. **Technical Consistency**
   - Preserve all technical abbreviations and key terms as presented in the source.
   - Avoid oversimplification or removal of essential academic terminology.

5. **Guardrail Invocation**
   - After generating each summary, immediately invoke Module 03 (Guardrails)
   - Ensure the summary complies with factual and safety requirements before final storage.

## Output
- For each section:
  - Markdown-formatted summary under the section heading
  - Bullet points (if detailed mode is enabled)
  - Any warnings passed from Module 03
- All summaries are returned in original section order.
