Module 03: Guardrails

Change Log
- Added an evidence_mode variable for stricter evidence requirements.
- Set up standard warnings for missing, empty, or very short sections.
- Improved logic to catch hallucinations.

Logic & Steps

1. Evidence Mode Variable
Set evidence_mode to either "standard" or "strict."

2. Strict Evidence Mode
When evidence_mode is "strict":
- The summarizer sticks to facts found in the original section—no guesses, no outside info.
- If there isn’t enough detail, just say:
  "The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode."

3. Section Validation

If the section is missing or empty:
- Say:
  "Section skipped: no usable text was provided."
- Don’t try to summarize.

If the section is under 50 words:
- Go ahead and summarize, but add this warning:
  "Section very short: summary may be incomplete."

4. Blocking Hallucinations
- Check that every summary only pulls from the original section.
- Don’t add made-up facts, guesses, or outside sources.

5. Enforcing Accuracy
- Match each summary sentence to the original text.
- Cut or change anything that doesn’t line up.

Output
- Only show summaries that pass these checks.
- Add standard warning messages as needed.
- If strict mode rules are broken, swap the summary with the proper explanation.
