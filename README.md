The generated `system_prompt.md` and `/modules` meet the requirements of Set 1: PS2 specification, including explicitly quoted inputs, outputs, and constraints.  They also contain the necessary system-prompt components, such as a greeting, tone, input handling, boundary setting, and mandated output sections.  Furthermore, they include the four core modules, two student-created modules, a strict evidence guardrail with the exact standard message, standardized warnings for missing, empty, or under 50-word content, deterministic formatting, and a modular flow consistent with the described architecture.  Module 02 features a `summary_level` option with “short” and “detailed” (paragraphs plus 3–5 bullets).  Module 03 specifies `evidence_mode = “strict”` and the exact warning strings.
